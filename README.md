Menu maintains its dominant position in restaurant firms, since it is the core of food and
beverage operations. In fact, in contemporary understandings of menu, it has material and
immaterial meanings. Materially, menu is a list or a card which documents the food and
beverage options being offered by a restaurant. Menu also functions as a communicating
and selling tool Kincaid and Corsun, 2003). More specifically, it communicates not only
the food and beverage offerings, but also the image of the firm. Furthermore, it is a base
on which the customers make their food choices and a well-designed menu can direct
customers&#39; attention to the items the firm wants to sell more (Antun and Gustafson,
2005). It is placed on every table in a restaurant or hanged on the wall. This means that a
customer will have to move from one restaurant to another perusing the menu to find his
or her taste. This is time consuming and especially in this era of knowledge based
economy and the growing pressure on the world to engage in computerized services, it
impacts negatively on the business. Countries like Kenya and other Third World
Countries all suffer from one similar problem; marketing and advertising of menu.
Mobile and online applications can be one of the best ways to keep consumers engaged
with a menu as they are on the move. The main aim of this project is to build an Android
application that helps the customer to access products in a specified way and according to
their specified tastes, the main features provided by the Restaurant picker Application.
